# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning 💼📊

Have you ever wondered how companies determine salaries based on experience, education, or job roles? 🤔  
This project answers that question using **Machine Learning** to predict employee salaries based on real-world data!

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Predict employee salaries using supervised machine learning, helping HR teams and job seekers make better decisions.

**Tech Stack Used:**
- 🐍 Python
- 📚 Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- 📈 Model: Linear Regression
- 💻 Platform: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## ❓ Why This Project?

> “How much salary should a 5-year experienced developer earn in Mumbai?”  
> “What role does education or job title play in salary decisions?”  
> “Can we create a model that predicts salaries before hiring?”

This project tries to **answer these questions using data**! 🔍

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Process

1. 📥 Data Collection  
   - Loaded dataset containing experience, education, company, and salary

2. 🧼 Data Preprocessing  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Encoded categorical features

3. 📊 Visualization  
   - Explored trends using bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps

4. 🧠 Model Building  
   - Applied Linear Regression to predict salary  
   - Split data into training and test sets (80:20)

5. 📈 Model Evaluation  
   - Used R² Score, MAE, and RMSE to validate performance  
   - Visualized predicted vs actual salaries

---

## ✅ Results

- R² Score: ~0.92 (high accuracy)  
- Low RMSE → Good prediction quality  
- Graphs show a strong correlation between experience & salary

---

## 📌 Conclusion

- Linear Regression is effective for salary prediction  
- Clean, structured data leads to accurate results  
- The model can help HR teams estimate fair salaries based on multiple factors

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Try Random Forest or XGBoost for higher accuracy  
- Build a Streamlit app to input new employee data  
- Add more features: location, skills, performance ratings, etc.
